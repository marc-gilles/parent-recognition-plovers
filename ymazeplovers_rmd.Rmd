# Data

## Data for analysis

*In the data used for the analysis, each row corresponds to a trial.*\

Import data
```{r, results = 'hide'}
data <- read.csv("ymazeplovers_data_horizontal.csv")
```

Check data
```{r, results = 'hide'}
str(data)
```

Convert variables that need to be converted
```{r, results = 'hide'}
data$trial_type <- as.factor(data$trial_type)
data$nest <- as.factor(as.character(data$nest))
data$first_type <- as.factor(data$first_type)
```

For two chicks, trial A was unsuccessful and was repeated one day later. Remove the first trial of each chick (76 trials - 2 = 74 trials) so that we have no repeated data for each chick.
```{r}
data <- data[data$trial != "19A" & data$trial != "20A",]
```

Calculate the proportion of time spent with unrelated adult odour relative to time spent with both odours
```{r, results = 'hide'}
data$prop_dur_np <- data$np_duration/(data$left_duration+data$right_duration)
```

*Chicks participated in two consecutive trials:*\
*- Conspecific odour discrimination (trial A): unrelated adult odour vs no odour*\
*- Parent odour discrimination (trial B): unrelated adult odour vs parent odour*\

### Data for conspecific odour discrimination (trial A)

Subset data on successful trials A (N = 29)
```{r, results = 'hide'}
data_a <- data[data$trial_type == "A" & data$trial_success == 1,]
```

Subset data excluding trials where the sex of the unrelated adult odour is unknown (N = 29 - 1 = 28)
```{r, results = 'hide'}
data_a_sex <- data_a[!is.na(data_a$np_sex),]
```

Sex of unrelated parent odours used in trials A
```{r}
table(data_a$np_sex)
```

### Data for parent odour discrimination (trial B) 

Subset data on successful trials B (N = 24)
```{r, results = 'hide'}
data_b <- data[data$trial_type == "B" & data$trial_success == 1,]
```

Subset data excluding trials where the sex of the odour (unrelated adult or parent) is unknown (N = 24 - 1 = 23)
```{r, results = 'hide'}
data_b_sex <- data_b[!is.na(data_b$np_sex) & !is.na(data_b$p_sex),]
```

Sex of odours (unrelated adult or parent) used in trials B
```{r}
table(data_b$p_sex, data_b$np_sex, deparse.level = 2)
```

Create a new variable describing the combination of sex of odours (parent and unrelated adult odour) used in trials B
```{r}
data_b_sex$odour_sex_comb <- paste(data_b_sex$p_sex,data_b_sex$np_sex)
table(data_b_sex$odour_sex_comb)
```

### Preference measures

*To measure the preference of the chicks to the different odours (trial A: unrelated adult vs control, trial B: unrelated vs parent), we test used two measures: time spent with odour and odour visited first.*

*1. Time spent with odour (overall preference): proportion of time spent with unrelated adult odour relative to time spent with both odours*

*For trial A:*\
- *values > 0.5 indicate a preference (more time spent) for the unrelated adult odour*\
- *values < 0.5 indicate a preference (more time spent) for the control*\

*For trial B:*\
- *values > 0.5 indicate a preference (more time spent) for the unrelated adult odour*\
- *values < 0.5 indicate a preference (more time spent) for the parent odour*\

*2. Odour visited first (first choice)*

*The odour visited first may indicate a preference for that odour.*\


Check whether the preference measures are independent:

In trials A, is the time spent with an odour related to whether this odour was visited first?
```{r}
t.test(data_a[data_a$first_type=="np",]$prop_dur_np, data_a[data_a$first_type=="c",]$prop_dur_np)
```

*In trials A, chicks spent more time with the odour they visited first (i.e. the measures are not independent)*\

In trials B, is the time spent with an odour related to whether this odour was visited first?
```{r}
t.test(data_b[data_b$first_type=="np",]$prop_dur_np, data_a[data_b$first_type=="p",]$prop_dur_np)
```

*In trials B, chicks did not spend more time with the odour they visited first (i.e. measures are independent).*\

# Analysis

## Conspecific odour discrimination (trial A)

### Time spent with odour

Mean time (and SD) spent by chicks in each arm
```{r}
mean_np <- mean(data_a$np_duration)

           Mean = c(mean_np, mean_c),
           SD = c(sd_np, sd_c))

```

Verify that the response variable is normally distributed
```{r, fig.dim = c(6, 2.5), fig.align="center"}

*Chicks spent has much time in the arm with the unrelated adult odour as in the arm with no odour, they showed no preference.*\

To run a beta regression, we need to transform the response variable (proportion of time spent with the unrelated adult odour) so that it does not include any 0 or 1.

Check model assumptions
```{r, fig.dim = c(8, 6), fig.align="center"}

```

Verify that there is no side bias: create the response variable (proportion of time spent on the left side) and run a one-sample t-test
```{r}
data_a$prop_left <- data_a$left_duration/(data_a$left_duration + data_a$right_duration)

## Probability and latency to leave the acclimation chamber

*In this exploratory analysis, we want to test if the sex and age of the chick has an effect on the probability and latency to leave the acclimation chamber, when they were in the Y-maze for the first time (novel environment).*

### Probability to leave the acclimation chamber

Subset data on all trials A where the sex of the chick is known (N = 42 chicks)
```{r}
data_prob <- data[data$trial_type == "A" & !is.na(data$sex),]
```

Distribution of the variable (binary)
```{r}
table(data_prob$trial_success, data_prob$sex)
```

GLMM (binomial)
```{r}
prob <- lme4::glmer(trial_success ~ sex + age + (1|nest), family = binomial(link = "logit"), data = data_prob)
summary(prob)
```

Beta estimates (with confidence intervals) of fixed effects
```{r}
broom.mixed::tidy(prob, conf.int = TRUE)
```

Calculate the exponential of the log-odds ratio to get the odds ratio for sex (with 95% confidence interval)
```{r}
exp(summary(prob)$coefficients["sexm",1] + 
      qnorm(c(0.025,0.5,0.975)) * summary(prob)$coefficients["sexm",2])
```

*Odds of leaving the chamber are 89% (estimate = 0.11, 95% CI = [0.02, 0.77]) lower if the chick is a male (12/23 = 52% of the males left the chamber) compared to a female (16/19 = 84% of females left the chamber).*\

Calculate the exponential of the log-odds ratio to get the odds ratio for age (with 95% confidence interval)
```{r}
exp(summary(prob)$coefficients["age",1] + 
      qnorm(c(0.025,0.5,0.975)) * summary(prob)$coefficients["age",2])
```
*Odds of leaving the chamber were 17% (estimate = 0.83, 95% CI = [0.74, 0.93]) lower if chicks were one day older.*\

Check model assumptions
```{r, fig.dim = c(8, 8), fig.align="center"}
check_model(prob)
```

Check overdispersion
```{r}
check_overdispersion(prob)
```

### Latency to leave the acclimatiom chamber

Subset data on all successful trials A where the sex of the chick is known (N = 28, including 16 females and 12 males) 
```{r}
data_lat <- data[data$trial_type == "A" & data$trial_success == 1 & !is.na(data$sex),]
table(data_lat$sex)
```

Distribution of the response variable
```{r, fig.dim = c(4, 2.5), fig.align="center"}
ggplot(data_lat, aes(x=out_time)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth=120, alpha=.2, fill="black") + 
  theme_classic() + ggtitle("Histogram") + 
  xlab("Latency to leave the acclimation chamber (s)") + ylab("Count")
```

GLMM (gamma)
```{r}
lat <- lme4::glmer(out_time ~ sex + age + (1|nest), family = Gamma(link=log), data = data_lat)
summary(lat)
```

Beta estimates (with confidence intervals) of fixed effects
```{r}
broom.mixed::tidy(lat, conf.int = TRUE)
```

Exponentiate the log-estimates to get the estimates for sex (with confidence intervals)
```{r}
exp(summary(lat)$coefficients["sexm",1] + 
    qnorm(c(0.025,0.5,0.975)) * summary(lat)$coefficients["sexm",2])
```

*Males wait 3 times longer (estimate = 3.32, 95% CI = [1.05, 10.56]) before leaving the chamber than females.*\

Exponentiate the log-estimates to get the estimates for age (with confidence intervals)
```{r}
exp(summary(lat)$coefficients["age",1] + 
    qnorm(c(0.025,0.5,0.975)) * summary(lat)$coefficients["age",2])
```

*Chicks waited 23% longer (estimate = 1.23, 95% CI = [1.08, 1.39]) before leaving the chamber if they were one day older.*\

Check model assumptions
```{r, fig.dim = c(8, 8), fig.align="center"}
check_model(lat)
```

Check for multicollinearity (sex and age)
```{r}
t.test(data_lat[data_lat$sex=="f",]$age, data_lat[data_lat$sex=="m",]$age)
```

*Because the model on the latency to leave included only chicks that left the chamber, and because older males were less likely to leave the chamber, the average age of males (3.6 days old) that left the chamber was somewhat higher than that of females (6.8 days old), although not significantly.*\
